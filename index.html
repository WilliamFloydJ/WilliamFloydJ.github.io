          Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Rolling through the flat lands in a
          matter of days. This was done through an alliance between Germany and
          Russia. They attacked from both sides. Poland's technically limited
          military had no chance against the speed of the two largest armies in
          the world. Although Germany and Russia started off as allies, Adolf
          hitler found plans in the soviet union (Russia). Changing the course
          of human history, Germany advanced into the heart of Russia in 1941.

          Through the hell of war. People find happiness. World war 1 ,though it
          was roughly 25 years prior, kept the world in a global depression.
          Emotionally and economically, through world war 2 humanity found its
          feet again. Propelling us into a economic boom, no one saw coming.
          simultaneously starting off the age of the baby boomers. Almost
          quadrupling the global population. Safe to say, its thanks to millions
          of peoples sacrifice that were here today.

          The allies as of the start of World war 2, was just France, United
          Kingdom, and their colonies. In 1940, half a year after Germanies
          invasion and take over of Poland. Germany invaded France. Unlike in
          World war 1, Germany was not stopped in Belgium. Germany stealthily
          moved into France through the large forrest called the Arden located
          in Luxembourg. The Germans drove straight into Paris. It wasn't until
          1944 in the battle of D-day that Germany was pushed from of France.
